yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory  given high susceptibility is a core driver. here  we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the sars-cov-2 pandemic probing different scenarios of climate-dependence based on known coronavirus biology. we find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections  during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as sars-cov-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration. our results suggest that  in the absence of effective control measures  significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid  climates  irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.the sars-cov-2 pandemic represents a generational public health concern. sustained local transmission is present in multiple countries  in all continents  and the implications in terms of morbidity and mortality are expected to be severe [1  2] . the role of seasonal and geographic climate variations in modulating the transmission of the virus has received increasing attention. studies using a regression framework have found a role for temperature  relative humidity and specific humidity in the transmission of sars-cov-2 [3  4  5  6  7]   suggesting that cold  dry conditions increase the transmission of the virus. however  with limited data on the current epidemic  these early-stage results are inevitably inconclusive. furthermore  the relative importance of climate drivers when compared to high population susceptibility during the pandemic stage of an emerging infection such as sars-cov-2  has not been fully characterized. climate affects the transmission of several directly-transmitted pathogens . specific humidity has been shown to be important for influenza transmission in both laboratory settings [9  10  11]   as well as in population-level studies . respiratory syncytial virus   a childhood pathogen  has also been found to be dependent on specific humidity and exhibits latitudinal correlations with climate . for both influenza and rsv  low specific humidity increases transmission and epidemics tend to peak in the wintertime in northern latitudes. however  other directly-transmitted infections exhibit different patterns   with enteroviruses  for instance  often peaking in the summer months . prior work on climate and directly-transmitted diseases has typically considered endemic infections  such as seasonal influenza or rsv. emerging pathogens  in contrast  have distinct dynamics driven by high population susceptibility. a key question is the extent to which seasonal and geographic climate variations are relevant in the pandemic phase of an emerging infection. here we build on known features of coronaviruses and other directly-transmitted infections to probe this question. although we do not yet know the climate sensitivity of sars-cov-2 transmission directly  data exists on four other coronaviruses that currently circulate in human populations. two of these coronaviruses  hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43  are of the same betacoronavirus genus as sars-cov-2 . we use data on hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 from us census regions to understand the potential climate dependence of betacoronavirus transmission . we fit a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible  model to case data of hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 where the fitted parameters include the climate dependence of transmission and the length of immunity following infection. all other parameters are fixed  based on values from kissler et al 2020 . motivated by the climate-dependence of influenza and rsv  we posit that transmission depends on specific humidity  we use population-weighted average climatology of specific humidity over 2014-2020 taken from the era5 reanalysis dataset   with population data from . 2 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in perpetuity. is the  the copyright holder for this  .   medrxiv  after fitting the model parameters  we run simulations of the sars-cov-2 pandemic under three scenarios. in the first scenario we assume sars-cov-2 has the same sensitivity to climate as influenza  based on a prior model from laboratory studies [9  12] . in the second and third scenarios  we assume sars-cov-2 has the same climate dependence and length of immunity as hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 respectively. while we assume the climate dependence is the same as these three infections  our simulations use r0 based on current estimates of sars-cov-2 .. we first look at the seasonality of the endemic betacoronaviruses. fig.1 shows average monthly specific humidity and normalized cases  for oc43 and hku1 in the us. cases of both diseases increase as specific humidity declines. for comparison  we show the relationship between specific humidity and sars-cov-2 in wuhan  china during the first 9 weeks of 2020. in contrast to the endemic coronaviruses  cases of covid-19 shown an increase with humidity. as explored below  this does not mean that high humidity increases transmission  but that pandemics driven by novel pathogens may exhibit distinct patterns compared to endemic diseases . we assume that to some extent transmission will decline with specific humidity  however  the extent of the decline is yet to be determined. we characterize the link between specific humidity and the transmission of sars-cov-2 using plausible estimates derived from the two endemic betacoronaviruses as well as influenza. fig.2 shows different potential functional forms for the climatetransmission relationship. changes to specific humidity modulate r 0 between a maximum wintertime value 3 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in perpetuity. is the  the copyright holder for this  . and a hypothesized lower bound  taken from prior studies . in the extreme cases  transmission  either rapidly declines as specific humidity increases or has no relationship with specific humidity. the highlighted influenza relationship is based on laboratory studies using the guinea pig animal model [9  11  10]   and later used to predict influenza epidemics in human populations . in this case r 0 values correspond to sars-cov-2 estimates. the other two scenarios in fig.2 correspond to the relationship between climate and oc43 and hku. transmission. we evaluate the functional form of this relationship by fitting our climate-driven sirs model to us case data for the two infections . our results  suggest a somewhat wide range of climate dependency for the two coronaviruses  with hku1 having a much steeper response to specific humidity when compared to oc43. strong seasonal forcing has been linked to biennial outbreaks  as observed for hku1  in other respiratory pathogens and implies dynamics driven by herd immunity. however this inference may be complicated by cross-protection from other circulating strains . while there is some uncertainty in our estimates  simulating a pandemic outbreak using a range of climate-transmission dependencies allows us to explore a wide plausible range of potential climate effects. . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in

specific humidity . we stress that these simulations explore only the interaction of the epidemic  model clockwork and seasonality in transmission; they do not address complexities 5 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in perpetuity. we also simulate the pandemic in a range of southern hemisphere locations  . we do not see a delay in the peak of southern hemisphere locations  despite distinct seasonality when compared to the northern hemisphere. for the oc43 scenario  pandemics are temporally aligned across all locations and of similar magnitude. a stronger climate response for influenza and hku1 parameters leads to slight regional differences. it is worth noting that our different scenarios also reflect a range of immunity lengths. the size of the pandemic peak is not affected by changes in immunity length  but the timing of latter stage outbreaks is partially dictated by this parameter. the differential timing of secondary peaks in the influenza and hku1 scenarios  which have a similar climate-dependence  is driven by this variability. during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen the lack of population immunity  i.e. high susceptibility  is a crucial driver. to illustrate this in the general case  we run our simulation model for different climates  and different levels 6 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in perpetuity. is the  the copyright holder for this  .   medrxiv  of population susceptibility. fig.4 shows the results in terms of the size of the summertime pandemic peak. while humidity range does modulate pandemic size  population susceptibility exhibits a much steeper gradient. for novel pathogens  such as sars-cov-2  the proportion of the population susceptible to infection may be close to 1. to illustrate the potential longer term behaviour of the pandemic  we plot a typical pandemic trajectory on the si phase plane  . the initial pandemic trajectory  is relatively independent of seasonal forcing. this then gives way to the endemic attractor  which oscillates around the equilibrium of the unforced model . these longer term dynamics show a much stronger signature of seasonal forcing than the pandemic phase. note that we ignore the effects of control measures and potential coronaviral competition in the simulations. there are several caveats to interpreting these results. primarily  our simulations do not address control measures  such as social-distancing  that are being implemented in many countries at present. our model also does not account for potential cross-protection from other coronavirus infections . finally  results from influenza and rsv suggest that high precipitation may play a role in driving transmission [13  22]   particularly in tropical locations. due to limited data on betacoronaviruses from tropical locations  we have not been able to confirm whether a rainfall signal exists. our results suggest that while climate may play a role in modulating detailed aspects of the size and timescales of a pandemic outbreak within a particular location  population immunity is a much more fundamental driver. although our hku1 scenarios presents a modest role for climate in terms of shifting the timing and intensity of the pandemic  a scenario with oc43 parameters is equally likely. in terms of the sars-cov-2 pandemic  our results imply that both tropical and temperate locations should prepare for severe outbreaks of the disease and that summertime temperatures will not effectively limit the spread the infection. however  this does not mean the climate is not important in the longer term. endemic cycles of the disease will likely be tied to climate factors and seasonal peaks may vary with latitude  . a more detailed understanding of climate drivers as well as immunity length will be crucial for understanding secondary outbreaks. furthermore  weather and near-term climate forecasts could be helpful for predicting such outbreaks after the initial pandemic phase has passed. 7 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder  who has granted medrxiv a license to display the  in perpetuity. is the  the copyright holder

of attenuation were hit-and-miss  and these are now much improved by genetic engineering. but even current attenuation methods operate on the principle of genetic harm  reducing the virus's ability to grow  which in turn limits the host immune response below that of infection by wild-type. we use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus and its control by innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus growth and the generation of immunity. our analysis suggests that directed attenuation that disables key viral defenses against the host immune responses may attenuate viral growth without compromising  and potentially even enhancing the generation of immunity. we explore which immune evasion pathways should be attenuated and how attenuating multiple pathways could lead to robust attenuation of pathology with enhancement of immunity.many highly successful viral vaccines use live attenuated viruses  which are typically variants of the wild-type virus that have a genetically reduced capacity to grow [1  2  3] . attenuated vaccines are considered to offer superior protection over other types of vaccines . early methods of attenuation were haphazard  relying on adaptation to viral growth in unnatural  artificial conditions to indirectly evolve a virus with reduced capacity to grow in the natural host. the fact that attenuation by this largely blind method was repeatable at all suggests that there is a broad window of viral growth reduction compatible with practical vaccine attenuation. viral attenuation entered a new era with genetic engineering  when it became possible to achieve quantitative reductions in viral growth rate and to block evolutionary reversion of attenuation [5  6  7  8  9  10] . much of the guesswork in reducing viral growth rate is eliminated with genetic engineering approaches  and the engineering can likewise slow or block the vaccine's ability to reverse the changes and become virulent. now  genetic engineering may be ushering in a third era  one in which attenuation is designed to enhance the immune response. such 'directed attenuation' will require genetically altering  the virus in a manner that reduces pathology while enhancing the level of protective immunity. in this paper we use the term directed attenuation to refer to engineering viral genomes to influence the level of immunity. the need for new methods of viral attenuation is not necessarily obvious. many attenuated vaccines in use -created by old methods -have brought about dramatic reductions in the prevalence of infections with few side effects  so is there anything to be gained from changing their design? however  live attenuated vaccines typically do not elicit as much immunity as natural infection [11  12  13  14  15  16] . this can potentially result in reinfection with circulating virus (e.g. for mumps where the and necessitates periodic boosting [12  17] . furthermore at a more fundamental level  vaccines remain elusive for many viruses [18  19  20  21  22] and require exploration of alternative approaches to vaccine design. it is not a trivial matter to engineer a live vaccine and knowingly vary the immune response. it has become practical to engineer a virus to knowingly reduce the pathology . however current attenuation compromises the growth of the virus  leads to reduced viremia that typically elicits a smaller immune response . the issue here is to attenuate the growth of the virus without compromising long term immunity  perhaps even elevating it. doing so requires understanding the complex interactions and feedbacks between virus growth and generation of adaptive immunity. the first step involves characterizing the different viral proteins and how they interact with the cells and molecules involved in the generation of immune responses -the subject of recent advances in molecular and cellular virology and immunology . yet a qualitative understanding of these pathways is not enough  non-linear feedbacks between virus growth and immunity make it hard to comprehend the effect of modifying viral genes and proteins on the level of immunity generated. can directed attenuation enhance immunity without increasing pathology? it is not clear if this is possible -targeting pathways that interfere with host immunity may simply result in more rapid virus clearance  and consequently less clonal expansion and immunity at the end of the infection. the approach to directed attenuation presented here is to develop a mathematical model that incorporates key elements of our current understanding the replicating virus and the immune response it elicits. we then use the model to explore whether directed attenuation might simultaneously reduce pathology and enhance immunity  and if so  to identify candidate pathways for virus engineering. we use a deliberately simple model for the dynamics of infection with virus or liveattenuated vaccine. let v equal the virus density and z and x equal the magnitude of the innate and adaptive responses respectively; all are functions of time. the virus grows exponentially at rate r in the absence of innate and adaptive immunity. virus is killed by innate and adaptive immunity at rates proportional to current immunity levels and the parameters k z and k x respectively. innate immunity  z  is activated by infection and saturates at 1  so z equals the fraction of the the maximum value of innate immunity. adaptive immunity  x  grows in proportion to innate immunity . this representation is a modification of that usually used  where the stimulation of adaptive immunity depends only on the amount of virus v . it is justified on biological grounds that the generation of immune responses requires stimulation by innate immunity and that this can occur even after replicating antigen is cleared. we let the extent of pathology  p   equal the maximum level of virus. the basic form is similar to that used previously [26  27  28  29  30  31] . the model is intended to capture basic properties of the immune response  helping discover unintuitive interactions and feedback effects that arise as a consequence of viral growth that interferes with the host's immune response. this model does not pretend to 4 parameter description value and range r virus growth rate 3d \\u22121  innate immunity s z

for example  it does not include different populations of innate and immune cells or cytokines generated during immune responses. the inclusion of these details at this stage would lead to a complex model with no hope of parameterization. in these situations  simple models are often more robust and perform better than more complex ones [32  33] . dynamics of an acute infection are straightforward . the virus initially grows exponentially. soon thereafter the innate immune system is triggered and begins to limit viral growth. but innate immunity is temporary and decays to zero after the virus is cleared. the adaptive immune response is somewhat delayed relative to innate immunity  it is responsible for clearance of the infection and is subsequently maintained. as we are focused on the generation of adaptive immunity to the virus we do not consider subsequent waning of immunity at this stage. the original approach for attenuating a virus was to grow it in unnatural conditions . adaptation to the unnatural conditions often -but unpredictably -reduced growth rate in the primary host   with consequent loss of pathogenesis. newer methods of engineered attenuation also lower viral growth rate but do so far more predictably [4  10] . with a viral growth rate less than wild-type  the atten- fection. virus  is shown in red  innate immunity  in black and adaptive immunity  in blue. the scale for virus and immunity is fold change over the initial value (v   and x are set to 1). the scale for innate immunity is percent of its maximum possible value  and in this simulation z attains only about 20% of its maximum. parameters are chosen for a biologically relevant regime as described earlier and are shown in table 1. uated virus attains in a smaller peak density before clearance and thus elicits less adaptive immunity. to wit  a single infection with wild-type measles  mumps or rubella viruses typically induces lifelong immunity [35  36]   while vaccine-induced immunity frequently requires boosting  as indicated by the cdc immunization schedule . this basic trade-off provides a baseline that should be reproduced by any reasonable model of viral-immune dynamics  reduced viral growth rate should result in reduced viral density before clearance . there should be a consequent reduced stimulation of adaptive immunity and a lower final level of adaptive immunity. our model indeed generates the expected patterns . this pattern highlights the fundamental question of our study  is it possible to engineer an attenuation that is better than achieved by merely reducing viral growth rate -can we arrange pathogenesis to go down but immunity go up? our approach to this question involves varying virus-effected parameters and observing changes in pathogenesis and in immunity  as done next. viruses have pathways that interfere with the innate or adaptive immune responses [37  38  39  40  41] . as these reduce the magnitude or effect of immunity they are candidate pathways  that if targeted  could lead to an increase in immunity. we model the suppression of these viral pathways as changes in the parameters that correspond to attenuation strategies -reducing pathogenesis . note that suppression of a viral pathway may result in an increase of the parameter value -which can occur when the wild-type virus depresses a host anti-viral response. virus strategies to evade innate immunity are modeled as low values of s z   high values of \\u03c6 v  and high values of d z . similarly viruses avoid stim-6 . cc-by-nc 4.0 international

immunity. blocking  any viral immune-evasion pathway leads to attenuation of the virus  . all are thus potential routes for generation of a live attenuated virus vaccine. but how might those changes affect the level of immunity? blocking pathways that make the virus more sensitive to clearance by either innate  or adaptive  immunity results in more rapid control of the virus but a lower final level of immunity. in contrast  blocking pathways that slow the generation of adaptive immunity  results in greater stimulation and a higher final level of adaptive immunity. finally  suppressing the viral pathway accelerating innate immune decay  prolongs the stimulation of adaptive immunity and increases its final level. thus attenuation by modifying immune-evasion pathways described by parameters s x   \\u03c6 z and d z generates the hoped-for outcome of reduced pathology with increased immunity. attenuation of other immune-evasion pathways  such as those associated with changes in the stimulation of innate immunity  or susceptibility to killing by innate or adaptive immunity   does not result in higher immunity. a more detailed consideration of the effect of changing parameters on the dynamics of infection and immunity is considered in supplemental file s1. a pathology-immunity plot enables easy comparison of attenuation strategies. the effects of different attenuation pathways may be directly compared by plotting them together in a grid of pathology and immunity  . the ideal live attenuated virus vaccine would generate lower pathology but higher immunity than infection with the wildtype virus  corresponding to the upper left quadrant . it is straightforward to see that directed attenuation works for the same three parameters identified above  d z   s x and \\u03c6 z . it is also seen that increasing sensitivity of innate immunity  leads to attenuation of pathology without compromising immunity. a summary of successful directed attenuation strategies by single parameter changes is given in table 2 . two potential problems with directed attenuation of a single viral anti-immune pathway are reversion and the consequences of vaccination of immunocompromised individuals. as we discuss later reversion may not be a significant problem  and we focus on inadvertent vaccination of immunocompromised individuals. the problem is especially apparent if a virus is attenuated by deletion of an antiviral strategy that targets a defense pathway lacking in the patient. the classic method of attenuation which compromises the growth of the virus  avoids this problem  or at least makes the infection less severe than that with wild-type virus. however if an individual was to overcome this prob- comparison of immunitypathology tradeoffs generated by changing single parameters. wild-type values are given at the intersection of the curves  so viable attenuation strategies would lie to the left. as the goal is to attenuate and to increase the immune response  the desirable attenuation strategies lie in the upper left quadrant. the tradeoff for the classic mode of attenuation -lowering growth rate r  -has the undesirable effect of lowering immunity. in contrast  decreasing the rate of loss of innate immunity   or increasing the rate of proliferation or sensitivity of adaptive immunity (s x \\u2191    \\u03c6 z \\u2193 ) leads to lowering pathology and increasing immunity. lem  directed attenuation could use a combination strategy. one type of combination is to block immune evasion while separately reducing growth rate. another type of combination is to block both evasion of adaptive immunity and evasion of innate immunity. a worry with combination strategies is that the reduced immunity might be too severe  can wild-type immunity be attained in a virus with classic growth rate reduction when an anti-immunity defense is also disabled? the answer appears to be affirmative for some combinations  . the top four panels show the effect of reducing viral growth rate  with the effect of changing one immune parameter. suppressing an immune-evasion pathway that changes the sensitivity of the adaptive immunity  or the decay rate innate immunity  restores vaccine immunity to the level elicited by the wild-type virus   and this is done without compromising the level of attenuation of pathogenesis that was obtained by the reduction in r . combinations are possible without altering growth rate   and some combinations may likewise result in reduced pathology with enhanced immunity  . the combination shown that does not change growth rate  suppresses viral evasion of innate immunity  while sensitizing adaptive immunity to stimulation by innate immunity . one of the striking observations from fig.  is that the effect of varying parameters is substantially different for the 3 cases. in the top row  immunity changes in response to both parameters  but pathology changes largely in response to the growth rate r. in the bottom row  immunity is strongly affected by the sensitivity of the adaptive response \\u03c6 z but largely unaffected by the sensitivity of the innate immune response \\u03c6 v   whereas pathology shows 11 . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license author/funder. it is made available under a the copyright holder for this   is the .   biorxiv  effect of changing growth rate and other parameters the goal is to have pathology become increasingly blue and immunity become increasingly red in traversing from wild-type to vaccine. the classical attenuation strategy arising from reductions in the single parameter r is seen to reduce both pathology and immunity . however  combining reductions in r with increasing the sensitivity of the adaptive immune response  or increasing the duration of innate immunity  restores the level of immunity generated by the vaccine to that induced by the wild-type virus . the bottom row shows that ideal attenuation can be achieved by changes in a pair of parameters that does not include r. much the opposite pattern. the middle row shows both pathology and immunity being affected by the combination of parameter values. these results reinforce the unintuitive nature of directed attenuation  and illustrate how models can be useful tools to understand the consequences of the non-linearities and feedbacks for different vaccination strategies. attenuated vaccines have been the mainstay of viral vaccines for close to a century [2  3  4] . attenuation is typically interpreted as a genetic reduction in viral growth rate   an outcome that should be easily achieved by almost any disruptive modification to the viral genome. advances in genetic engineering now enable attenuated designs that were previously unattainable  but even these have tended to be of a mode that disrupts viral growth [5  6  7  8  9  10] . here we suggest an extended approach to attenuation  one that directs the virus toward reduced defenses against host immunity. this approach to attenuation is suggested by the fact that many viruses directly interfere with the immune response [37  38  42  43  39  40  41]   and those interference genes are obvious targets for genetic engineering. targeting viral immune-evasion pathways compromises the viral load and in general results in a reduction of pathology. however  unlike reducing the virus growth rate which not only reduces pathology but also reduces the immune response  'directed' attenuation might instead increase the immune response. using a simple computational model of the immune response to viral infection  we indeed find that disruptions of some  but not all  viral antiimmune responses can attain the desirable goal of reduced pathology without compromising the generation of immunity. our model allows us to identify characteristics of the immuneevasion pathways that should be targeted to achieve the desired outcome. changing more than one parameter in the model allows us to explore the consequences of targeting multiple virus pathways. we suggest that an attenuated design that includes reduced viral growth rate together with disabling carefully chosen immune-evasion pathways would be ideal  in that it could provide enhanced immunity compared with natural infection along with reduced pathology  even in immune-compromised individuals. while we have focused on virus pathways that compromise the magnitude of the immune response  similar principles could be applied to virus pathways that compromise the maintenance of memory. it could also be extended to inactivated virus vaccines where genetic engineering to remove genes for virus proteins that inhibit the generation of immune responses may  enhance the immune response elicited by vaccination with the killed virus. examples of immune evasion strategies much of their genome encoding immune-evasion pathways [39  40  44] . these pathways target host type 1 interferon  tumor necrosis factors and the complement pathway of innate immunity. they also evade adaptive immunity by downregulating antigen presentation and by blocking costimulatory pathways and the apoptotic response. adenoviruses are medium-sized  non-enveloped viruses containing a double stranded dna genome. they encode immune-evasion pathways that inhibit tumor necrosis factor activity  and also evade adaptive immunity by downregulating antigen presentation [45  46  47] . one of the best studied immune-evasion genes is the ns1 protein of the influenza virus. the major function of ns1 protein is to interfere with multiple stages of the type 1 interferon signaling cascade [48  49  50  51  52] . mutant influenza virus lacking ns1 protein are highly attenuated in wild-type  mice  but not in ifnincompetant systems such as stat 1 knockout mice . viruses with a truncation or deletion of their ns1 gene have been shown to be promising candidates for a live attenuated vaccine in chicken [54  55] . type 1 interferon plays a role in reducing virus replication  which corresponds to a decrease in the growth rate of the virus  in our models without changing parameters that govern the generation of immune responses. changes in only the parameter r in our model results in less pathology and a smaller immune response. this is consistent with the outcome of experimental infections of chicken with influenza virus vaccines that have deletions in the ns1 protein . we suggest that it might be worth exploring the possibility of targeting other virus immune-evasion pathways so that the immune response is increased. our results are based on a simple model of the within-host dynamics of virus and immunity during acute infections. applying these models to specific viruses will require incorporating details of how that particular virus evades the immune response  as well as the relevant components of the immune response elicited by the virus. selecting appropriate immune-evasion pathways will certainly require experimental studies. these experiments would be along the lines of the studies of ns1 deletion of the influenza virus discussed earlier. the first step would be the generation of potential vaccine viruses by attenuating different immune-evasion genes  ideally in a graded manner. the vaccine candidates would be used to infect animals  allowing quantification of how different attenuation strategies affect both the dynamics of virus  and the generation of the immune response. intuiting the consequences of different mutations is challenging because of the non-linear feedbacks between control of virus and generation of host immunity. consequently  models that incorporate the relevant details of specific virus immune-evasion pathways may help suggest combinations of pathways to be targeted  and analysis of the results will in turn allow refinement of the models. at a more basic engineering level  we suggest that in addition to compromising virus immune-evasion genes   directed attenuation can involve up-regulation or addition of genes that enhance the generation of immunity. candidates for up-regulation or addition include pathogen associated molecular patterns  that induce the appropriate form of immunity. studies on surrogates of protection could help identify appropriate pamps for inclusion in the virus. one consideration is the possibility of virus reversion. gene additions are more likely to be prone to reversion through deletions and point mutations than gene deletions . however they  suggested that within-host vaccine evolution can compromise vaccine immunity only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe  and that this evolution may be avoided or mitigated by suitable choice of the vaccine inoculum. we have intentionally used simple models to illustrate the potential for directed attenuation strategies for the development of vaccines. this is because the particularities of each virus and its evasion mechanisms would require a model tailored to the relevant details  and generating one complex and general model is both unrealistic and intractable at the current time. there are some empirical complexities to include when considering the relevant details for a particular virus. at least for viruses with small genomes  genes with antiimmune functions may have pleiotropic effects  and it may be challenging to engineer them to retain other potentially essential functions while disrupting their anti-immune functions. pleiotropic effects resulting from disruption of an immune-evasion pathway could be incorporated into the models by allowing changes in more than one term and parameter. the current models would need to be extended to include scenarios where the extent of attenuation  depends on virus density  as has been suggested for some non-selfish virus evasion strategies . our current models of immunity do not include different branches  or the complex differentiation pathways for the generation of immunological memory. elaborations of the model are warranted  but any elaborations should be based on detailed consideration of a vaccination scenario for a specific virus. simple models omit many details but have the advantage that they are often more robust than highly complex ones [32  33] ; the current model incorporates the feedbacks between viral defenses and immune responses  which may be the key properties relevant to directed attenuation. summary. this study uses models to explore the consequences of attenuating a virus by targeting the interaction of the virus with the host's immune response  rather than by the more traditional approach of targeting viral growth rate. this approach allows us to explore how new vaccines may be designed with the goal of maximizing the level of protective immunity generated. contrary to the conventional view  it should be possible to engineer vaccines that provide stronger protection than that provided by natural infection. . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license author/funder. it is made available under a the copyright holder for this   is the .   biorxiv . in the si we use simulations of the dynamics of infection to give us an insight into the interactions that give rise to the tradeoffs observed when we attenuate various immuneevasion pathways of the virus. viruses can attenuate or evade innate immunity in a number of ways. in terms of the parameters of the model attenuation of innate immunity can occur by changes in 4 parameters  s z the rate at which innate immunity can be stimulated  \\u03c6 v the sensitivity of innate immunity to recognizing virus  d z the rate of waning of innate immunity  and k z the rate constant for killing of the virus by innate immunity. the sensitivity of innate immunity can be increased by reducing the virus density at which innate immunity is triggered  \\u03c6 v or the rate at which innate immunity is stimulated s z . as seen in fig 3 in both these scenario's we find that there is a significant reduction in the pathology but only a small reduction in the level of adaptive immunity generated. the reason for this can be seen in the representative simulations shown in fig 6a&b. we see that the more rapid generation of an innate response results in more rapid control  of the virus by innate immunity. as the adaptive immune response is needed for virus clearance we find that the duration of infection is not significantly affected and consequently the amount of adaptive immunity generated does not substantially. thus changing these two parameters can lead to a reduction in the level of pathology and smaller reduction in the generation of immunity. another way a virus can also evade innate immunity is by increasing the rate of decay of innate immunity  d z . as seen in fig 3  a vaccine strain of the virus that counters this by reducing the rate of decay of innate immunity will not only reduce the extent of pathology but interestingly can generate more immunity than is elicited by the wild-type vaccine strain. the cause of this can be seen in fig 6c where we find that the reduction in d . . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license author/funder. it is made available under a the copyright holder for this   is the .   biorxiv  results in a larger and longer innate response. this response controls the virus at a lower density and the longer duration of the response increases the stimulation of the adaptive immune response. the final way which consider for evasion of innate immunity is by decreasing the rate at which innate immunity kills the virus. a vaccine strain of virus that has an increased susceptibility to innate immunity will have lower pathology and lower immunity  . fig 6d shows the cause -the virus is more rapidly controlled and this results in a lower level of innate immunity and less stimulation of adaptive immunity. viruses can attenuate or evade adaptive immunity in a number of ways. in terms of the parameters of the model attenuation of adaptive immunity can occur by changes in 3 parameters  s x the maximum rate at growth of adaptive immunity  \\u03c6 z the sensitivity of stimulation of adaptive immunity to recognizing virus and d z and k x the rate constant for killing of the virus by adaptive immunity. as seen in fig 3 changes to the virus that increases in the rate of proliferation of adaptive immunity  either by increasing the rate of proliferation of immune cells s x or increasing the sensitivity of immune cells to stimulation \\u03c6 v results in attenuation  and higher levels of immunity. the reason for this can be seen in fig 7 where we see that increases in s x or decreases in \\u03c6 v result in faster / earlier growth of adaptive immunity. in both cases the more rapid generation of adaptive immunity results in earlier clearance of the pathogen and curtailing the both innate immunity and the stimulation of adaptive immunity -though the decrease in \\u03c6 v can to some extent compensate for this. as is the case for innate immunity  an increase in the rate of clearance of the virus by adaptive immunity leads to more rapid clearance of the virus which causes a decrease in pathology but also a decrease in the extent of stimulation and final level of adaptive immunity  . . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license author/funder. it is made

indrajit ghosh 1a   joydev chattopadhyay a 3 abstract . in this paper  we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths  direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. the direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. the system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number  is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. we numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to r 0 and the epidemic growth rate. local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. further  the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using li and muldowney geometric approach. the explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. the basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when r 0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. consequently  our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. however  efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. in addition  increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication. 7 12 directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly through a vector. understanding the transmission 13 dynamics of such diseases is of utmost interest. mathematical models of epidemic diseases have been 14 very insightful in uncovering epidemiology and transmission patterns of the diseases. it is very important 15 to understand such epidemic patterns for better public health interventions and control of outbreaks. 16 another important objective of these models is to inform public health organizations about the effect of 17 control policies on a certain population. however  hosts behaviour and psychological factors are some-18 times the main drivers of further transmission of the disease. for example  the epidemic outbreak of 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome   had such psychological effects and individual protection 20 1 doi  biorxiv  32 however  the dynamics of an epidemic model with two transmission routes where the direct trans-33 mission incorporates psychological effect has not been studied so far. the ongoing mers-cov epidemic 34 and zika virus epidemic are examples of diseases with two routes of transmission having psychological 35 effects. the psychosocial implication on the disease outbreak is more dangerous than any other phys-36 ical effect. west nile virus outbreak in the us is a good example for the onset of psychogenic illness 37  and may generate mistrust towards national or health authorities. for example  the mild effects 38 of zika virus  there is a correlation between psychosis with fetus microcephaly where pregnant women 3. and their relatives are highly sensitive group. therefore  there is a negative correlation between the 40 psychological effect and disease prevalence and hence we consider non-monotone incidence function i.e 41 p < q to describe the direct transmission between hosts in our study. this type of function can be used 42 to interpret the \\\"psychological effects\\\" . we use the incidence rate gs = \\u03b2is 1+\\u03b1i 2 where \\u03b2i repre-43 sent the force of infection of the diseases  1 1+\\u03b1i 2 represent the psychological effect from the behavioral 44 changes of susceptible population when the number of infected populations increases. our goal is to 45 develop a simple mathematical model that capture a range of disease dynamics with multiple mode of 46 transmissions. moreover  we would like to perform a detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of the 47 proposed model. by using analytical methods we intend to uncover the dynamical properties of the 48 diseases with two routes of transmission. the rest of the paper is organized as follows  section 2 consist of the model formulation and the 50 basic assumptions. in section 3  preliminary mathematical analysis of the proposed model is carried out. section 4 is devoted to the global stability of the endemic equilibrium using geometric approach while 52 in section 5 backward bifurcation and forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect is presented. in section 53 6 we investigate some numerical scenarios such as effect of temporary control on bistable dynamics  54 effect of the strength of psychological fear and impact of heterogeneity in indirect transmission. finally  55 discussion and conclusion is presented in section 7. 56 2. model formulation 57 we consider two population groups as host and vector population. time-dependent state variables 58 are taken to describe the compartments of the two populations. let at time t  n h  represents total 59 host population and n v  represents total vector population. we consider a 'sir' type model for the 60 host population and a 'si' type model for the vectors. the host population is subdivided into three 61 mutually disjoint classes  susceptible  s h ; infected  i h ; recovered  r h . thus  at any time t  the size of 62 the host population is given by n h = s h + i h + r h . the vector population consist of two classes namely  63 susceptible vectors  s v ; and infected vectors  i v . with this division  the size of the vector population 64 2 . cc-by 4.0 the basic reproduction number  r 0   is the number of secondary infections which one infected indi-102 vidual would produce in a entirely susceptible population. the disease free equilibrium  of the 103 system is given by y 0 = . there are two infected compartments in the model   i h 10. and i v . r 0 can be derived from the jacobian matrix of the system  calculated at y 0 together with 105 the assumption of local asymptotic stability of y 0 and is given bythe mode of transmission of some infectious diseases may be through both direct and indirect con-9 tact. in direct transmission  a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through infected host  and in 10 indirect transmission  a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through an infected vector. for instance  11 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus   and zika virus  may be spread both policies have been found very effective  in decreasing the rate of infection at the late stage of sars outbreak  even when the number of infective individuals were getting larger relatively. additionally  the influenza pandemic of 2009 has triggered a psychological effect that caused adoption of preventive 23 measures by a significant portion of the population . recent mers-cov outbreak in arabian penin-24 sula also imposed a significant behaviour change in the local people  . thus  psychological effects 25 are necessary in modelling infectious disease transmission. the general incidence rate in this context at time t is given by n v  = s v  + i v . we assume all newborn hosts are fully susceptible. the susceptible host population increases at a constant rate \\u03c0 h . the susceptible population decreases due to 66 getting infection from infected vectors and infected hosts and natural mortality at a rate \\u00b5 h . therefore. interpretations of all the model parameters and their biological meanings are given in the table 1 . we assume that the vector and host state variables are non-negative

another stable endemic equilibrium may 385 coexist simultaneously. when the multiple stable equilibrium coexist then the population will reach 386 the final equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. backward bifurcation phenomenon for the 387 system  is shown in fig. 1 . here  a stable dfe and a stable endemic equilibrium point coexist 388 when 0 < r c < r 0 < 1  where r c is the critical value  which is shown in fig. 1 and r c = 0.274 for the 389 given parameters values. in fig. 1   the green line represents the unstable equilibrium  while the blue line is established analytically. the jacobian of the system  at diseases free equilibrium y 0 is given a. let \\u03b2 i be the bifurcation parameter and using r 0 = 1  we hav. here 0 is the simple eigen value and the jacobian j at \\u03b2 i = \\u03b2 * i has a right eigen vector corresponding eigen vector is given b. the following second order partial derivatives of g i at dfe y 0 are calculated as follows . we see that the coefficient b is always positive  hence the system  undergoes backward bifurcatio. the backward bifurcation phenomenon would occur for those values of r 0 such that r c < r 0 < 1.. for forward transcritical bifurcation usually a model has two locally stable branches  one is dfe 427 when r 0 < 1  which is locally asymptotically stable and another is endemic equilibrium when r 0 > 1  428 which is stable. but there may be more than one stable endemic equilibrium for the model when r 0 > 1. it is possible that more than one endemic equilibrium coexist in epidemic models even when r 0 > 1. this leads to an unusual phenomenon of forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect  which is shown 431 numerically for our model . we find that our model exhibits a hysteresis effect where multiple 432 endemic equilibrium coexist for r 0 > 1 . the blue line represents two outer equilibrium  433 which is stable while the green line represent the interior equilibrium  which is unstable. further investigation reveals that the endemic equilibrium may also be stable in a region where 435 r 0 < 1 . this indicates that the disease may persist for r 0 < 1  even if the type of 436 transcritical bifurcation at r 0 = 1 is forward. similarly  in case of hysteresis  these control measures will compel the solutions to the basin of attraction 447 of the lower endemic equilibrium. here  we control the indirect transmission rate  for a certain period 448 of time  to force the solutions of the system to lower endemic value. we use the following to model thi. for backward bifurcation case  we observe that a solution of the system approaches the upper equi- the vector-host interaction is assumed to be well-mixed in the proposed model 2.. similarly  the transmission term from infectious hosts to susceptible vectors is given by. here k 1 and k 2 are the levels of heterogeneity of vector-host and host-vector transmissions respec-480 tively. since k 1 and k 2 both are the levels of heterogeneity  we assumed that k 1 = k 2 = k for simplicity. therefore  replacing these heterogeneity terms into our model 2.1  we obtain the following system of. using numerical simulations  the impact of the heterogeneity parameter k have been studied. we the copyright holder for this   is the .   biorxiv  table 4   variation in the equilibrium susceptible host level and equilibrium infected host level due to changes in the parameters k  \\u03b2 i and \\u03b2v. further  we investigated the sensitivity of the parameters k  \\u03b2 i and \\u03b2 v with respect to the equilibrium 492 susceptible and infected host levels  table 4 . it is observed that the equilibrium infected host level 493 increases with increase in the parameter k. to switch the stability of equilibria. in case of backward bifurcation  temporary control can curb the 507 disease endemic equilibrium to disease free state. on the other hand  the system can be brought to lower 508 endemic levels by the employment of temporary control. we found that the strength of psychological 509 effect will have significant contribution in lowering the endemic infection level of the host population. further investigation reveals that increase in transmission heterogeneity will ensure fast eradication of 511 the disease. in summary  global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium indicate that the disease will persist 513 under certain parametrization of the system. additionally  the diseases with two transmission routes can 514 exhibit bi-stable dynamics. these bi-stable feature of the diseases may impose significant difficulties on 515 disease control strategies. moreover  efficient application of temporary control will be helpful in bi-stable 516 regions. while investigating the effect of heterogeneity  we observe that high levels of heterogeneities 517 will result in slower disease spread. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
